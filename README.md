## üõ† Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety and modern development
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design and consistent styling
- **Lucide React** for professional iconography
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds

### Matching Algorithm
- Custom compatibility scoring engine
- Gender-specific matching logic
- Multi-factor analysis (age, income, height, values, lifestyle)
- AI-enhanced personality compatibility assessment

### AI Integration
- Intelligent match scoring with explanations
- Automated introduction generation
- Personality and lifestyle compatibility analysis
- Natural language reasoning for profile compatibility

## üìä Matching Logic

### For Male Customers
The algorithm prioritizes matches based on traditional preferences:
- **Age**: Prefers women who are younger (0-8 years younger optimal)
- **Income**: Favors women with lower income (up to 80% of male's income)
- **Height**: Seeks shorter partners (5-20cm difference ideal)
- **Family Planning**: Strong weight on aligned views about children
- **Location**: Considers relocation flexibility

### For Female Customers
The algorithm focuses on compatibility and stability:
- **Professional Compatibility**: Career level balance and growth potential
- **Financial Stability**: Prefers financially secure partners
- **Values Alignment**: Religion, family values, and life goals
- **Lifestyle Compatibility**: Relocation openness, pet preferences
- **Age Compatibility**: Slight preference for older or same-age partners

### AI Enhancement
The AI layer adds sophisticated analysis:
- **Personality Compatibility**: Education level matching, language compatibility
- **Lifestyle Analysis**: Family structure similarity, work culture alignment
- **Contextual Scoring**: Dynamic adjustments based on profile combinations
- **Explanation Generation**: Natural language reasoning for match recommendations

## üéØ Key Assumptions

1. **Gender-Specific Preferences**: Implemented traditional Indian matchmaking preferences while maintaining respect and professionalism
2. **Data Privacy**: All customer data is mock/simulated for demonstration purposes
3. **AI Simulation**: Uses rule-based intelligence to simulate AI capabilities (ready for OpenAI API integration)
4. **Scalability**: Designed with modular architecture for easy expansion and real database integration
5. **User Experience**: Prioritized intuitive navigation for busy matchmakers
